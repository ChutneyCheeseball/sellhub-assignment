# Store UI

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/create-next-app).

_The UI is primitive but functional, I did not spend much time on this and it is not an indication of the type of UI work I am used to delivering!_

## Getting Started

Run the development server with `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

## Using the UI

A product listing will be shown. Use the "Refresh" button to reload from database.

The UI allows you to place orders for each individual product using the number inputs and "Buy Now" buttons. The quantity of each item ordered is then subtracted from the database inventory count.
